It contains a Nx **integrated** monorepo, with support for **multiple stacks**:
- Angular - using the official plugin `@nx/angular`
- React - using the official plugin `@nx/react`
- Spring Boot - using the community plugin [`@nxrocks/nx-spring-boot`](https://github.com/tinesoft/nxrocks/blob/develop/packages/nx-spring-boot)

## Lab Setup

1. Go to `https://github.com/tinesoft/nx-multi-stacks-monorepo#how-to-recreate-this-exact-workspace`
